      It is with deep sadness that the team at CastawayMC announced the
      shutdown of our much-loved network.
      <strong>Monday July 14th, 2025</strong> was the final day for Castaway
      Islands. After this day, the CastawayMC game servers turned off for the
      very last time and players were no-longer able to connect.
    </p>

    <p>
      To all those who played Castaway over the years, we thank you immensely
      for the contributions to your amazing community. We appreciate every
      single one of you, because without you, Castaway wouldn't be what it is
      today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Castaway's community was like no other. You, the community, made it
      something more; something everyone will remember. We might remember
      Castaway differently, but we’ll all feel the same nostalgia.
    </p>

    <h2>The Unfinished Gamemode</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of 3.0 came about during the COVID-19 pandemic. After seeing
      the server's second wind in 2020, the team wanted to perpetuate the
      passion we saw for Castaway into the future. Since then, however,
      everything began reopening. Working-from-home was less prevalent. Having
      a cheeky little Minecraft sesh when you had an assessment due was no
      longer a possibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Work on 3.0 continued post-pandemic, but with less and less people
      playing regularly, we lost vision of what we were working towards.
      Developers were quickly burnt out, regulars stopped playing, and our
      backlog was piling up the more we worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every single person that worked on 3.0 had a vision for what they wanted
      to see. We had very high ambitions that we would create something that
      you guys would love and adore for the heck of it. We earned
      <em>nothing</em>. Working on the new gamemode was purely voluntary. Out
      of passion. Out of love. We loved our creation and we loved our
      community, but we were never able to spend enough time putting the two
      together.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.0 was more than just a version number, it was a full reimagination. We
      wanted to bring Castaway into the new era of Minecraft, with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A fully reworked survival experience</li>
      <li>Player-run economies with deeper, complex systems</li>
      <li>A new take on roles, crews, and exploration</li>
      <li>Lore and quests that actually meant something</li>
      <li>Dozens of small touches to make the server feel alive</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Discord</h2>

    <p>
      The CastawayMC Discord server is now invite-only. Access is limited to
      players who linked their Minecraft account to Discord before the server
      closed. We have made this decision to avoid confusion with similar
      servers still operating today, as well as to minimize spam.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you didn't link your accounts in time, please contact a member of the
      Castaway team or reach out to <strong>@Fantastic_Doge</strong> on
      Discord for assistance.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving On</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you were a Mythic or an OG, part of a crew or a solo sailor, we
      would love to see how much fun you had in the community. Send us your
      favorite screenshots in the Discord and share some fun memories from
      your time on CastawayMC.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we say goodbye, and as Castaway becomes a memory, we urge you to
      spread kindness. Wherever you go,
      <a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/rule1.html" target="_blank">remember the human</a>.
