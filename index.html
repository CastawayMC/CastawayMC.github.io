        It is with deep sadness that the team at CastawayMC announce the
        shutdown of our much-loved network.
        <strong>Monday July 14th, 2025</strong> will be the final day for
        Castaway Islands. After this day, the CastawayMC game servers will turn
        off for the very last time and players will no-longer be able to
        connect.
      </p>

      <p>
        To all those who played Castaway over the years, we thank you immensely
        for the contributions to your amazing community. We appreciate every
        single one of you, because without you, Castaway wouldn't be what it is
        today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Castaway's community was like no other. You, the community, made it
        something more; something everyone will remember. We might remember
        Castaway differently, but we’ll all feel the same nostalgia.
      </p>

      <h2>The Unfinished Gamemode</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of 3.0 came about during the COVID-19 pandemic. After seeing
        the server's second wind in 2020, the team wanted to perpetuate the
        passion we saw for Castaway into the future. Since then, however,
        everything began reopening. Working-from-home was less prevalent. Having
        a cheeky little Minecraft sesh when you had an assessment due was no
        longer a possibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Work on 3.0 continued post-pandemic, but with less and less people
        playing regularly, we lost vision of what we were working towards.
        Developers were quickly burnt out, regulars stopped playing, and our
        backlog was piling up the more we worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every single person that worked on 3.0 had a vision for what they wanted
        to see. We had very high ambitions that we would create something that
        you guys would love and adore for the heck of it. We earned
        <em>nothing</em>. Working on the new gamemode was purely voluntary. Out
        of passion. Out of love. We loved our creation and we loved our
        community, but we were never able to spend enough time putting the two
        together.
      </p>

      <p>
        3.0 was more than just a version number, it was a full reimagination. We
        wanted to bring Castaway into the new era of Minecraft, with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A fully reworked survival experience</li>
        <li>Player-run economies with deeper, complex systems</li>
        <li>A new take on roles, crews, and exploration</li>
        <li>Lore and quests that actually meant something</li>
        <li>Dozens of small touches to make the server feel alive</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We never reached the finish line, but we want to share some of the ideas
        and builds we were proudest of (there are some very good ones!). From
        today onwards, we’ll be posting some screenshots and docs which we
        created during the development of 3.0. It might not be a finished
        gamemode but we hope it still sparks joy.
      </p>

      <h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>
      <p>
        For obvious reasons, our online webstore is no-longer accepting
        payments. The request for a return or refund for any previous donations
        via the webstore cannot be honored. If you have keepsakes in-game, hop
        online and take a screenshot before it's too late.
      </p>

      <p>When it comes to the Discord:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Before the shutdown date</strong> — New members without a
          linked account and returning members with a linked account can join
          the Discord, so long as unlinked members link their account in-game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>At the shutdown date</strong> — Account linking is permanently
          disabled once the server goes offline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After the shutdown date</strong> — Only members with linked
          accounts will be able to join the Castaway Discord. Check if your
          account is linked by using <code>sb!link</code> in the Discord.
          <br />
          If your account was linked prior to shutdown, and remains linked, you
          can join/leave the Castaway Discord freely.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Moving On</h2>
